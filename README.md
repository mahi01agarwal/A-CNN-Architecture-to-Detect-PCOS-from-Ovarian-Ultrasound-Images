# A-CNN-Architecture-to-Detect-PCOS-from-Ovarian-Ultrasound-Images


## Project Description

This repository contains the implementation of an A-CNN (Attention Convolutional Neural Network) architecture designed to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) from ovarian ultrasound images. PCOS is a common hormonal disorder in women of reproductive age, and its detection from ultrasound images can aid in early diagnosis and treatment.

The A-CNN architecture incorporates attention mechanisms along with traditional convolutional neural networks to focus on relevant features in the ultrasound images, enhancing the model's ability to identify patterns associated with PCOS.


## Dataset

We used a curated dataset of ovarian ultrasound images for training and evaluating the A-CNN model. The dataset consists of both normal and PCOS-affected images, enabling the network to learn the distinguishing features between the two classes.
